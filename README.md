In this Project(Banglore House Price Prediction) we will first build a model using sklearn and linear Regression using banglore home price dataset from kaggle.com
Second step would be to write the python flask server that uses the saved model to server http requests.
Third components is the website built in html,css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area,bedroom etc
It will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
During model building we will cover almost all dataScience concepts such as dataload and cleaning,Outlier detection and removal,feature engineering.
technology and tools wise this project covered - 
1.python
2.Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3.matplotlib for data visualization
4.sklearn for model building
5.Jupyter Notebook ,and pycharm as IDE
6.Python flask for http server
HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT for UI
NOTE:javascript code was taken from one my friend(web developement aspirant)
